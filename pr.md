1. What did you like about this website?
    A1. The animation at the top is very well done and well incorporated into the flow of the website.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    A2. We have very functionally different P1's where is his more informative while mine is more of a show case of a portfolio.

    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        A1. I felt as if my p1 handled user navigation better by updating the active in the navbar from page to page along with hover elements, though his resizing feels more user friendly in my opinion due to how they had aligned elements on the page.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        A2. I felt as if Sarma's use of selectors for attributes was really well done, but I feel as if both code bases are equally as maintainable if not mine being a little bit less.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and   directories?
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    A3. The code is well structured, with a good reuse of structures where they are needed.

4. Did you find any other issues? if so, briefly enumerate them.
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    A1. Yes, I could not find any that weren't.
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    A2. Yes.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    A5. I felt as if the colors on the page we a little of putting next to the text. I saw that the active attribute to the nav bar was being used; however, it never updated to the current page which made navigation from page to page a little bit awkward when theres a visual element thats not being used. The form page for was really well done and well aligned, though a little bit of bottom padding on the forum subit button could add some aesthetic bonuses in the overall flow of the page.
