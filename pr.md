What did you like about this website?
    I really liked the color scheme that Deven choose, the salmon and black go really well together and I think that with his animation at the top of "Virginia is for lovers <3" it fits well with the loving portion. I also really like Devens nav bar, I like its sleek design and how it looks like a real websites nav bar. 

Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. 
    Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        I think both of our websites have a good user experience. Playing around with his was fun and I didn't see any glaring isssues, although I found one that I am sure he is aware of that really isn't an issue but is a taste thing for me. He made it so That everything scales down when appropriate so that whether you are on a phone, computer, or tablet all users have a great experience. I would, when we are on bigger screens, would take out the hambuger menu. I think it is good for small screens but I don't like how it stays on bigger ones. 
    Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        I believe that both are maintainable being they are simple static sites and don't have much going on. After looking through the code, I prefer Deven's sleekness of code to mine. I think I may have used more containers than I needed for claritys sake and that may have actually came back around to bite me and had the opposite affect after looking at his. 

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    The code is well structured in files. Deven placdd all CSS in a file named
    csss, images in images, and javascript in js, very well put together with 
    his index file outside a file so we don't have any weird redirecting.

Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    No new issues found.
    were semantically appropriate elements selected
        Yes, his elements are very self explanitory and do not lead to confusion.
    is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
        Yes, he has a main style css for overall looks and when he wanted certain looks for specific pages he went and made sure to break it out into another sheet and keep it there. 

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    I really liked your site, I think this is a useful site that people would want to use, only thing I don't like about it was said earlier. Otherwise, great site, very well done, great job!
